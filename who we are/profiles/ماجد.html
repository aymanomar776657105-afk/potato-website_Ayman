            <p> Majid Muzafar, a student with a diverse academic background, having initially studied Human Medicine
                at Sana'a University before transitioning to Civil Engineering in China. This unique combination
                reflects my adaptability, determination, and commitment to pursuing a field that aligns with my evolving
                interests and career goals. Throughout my studies, I focus on developing both theoretical knowledge and
                practical skills, embracing challenges as opportunities for growth. I am dedicated to continuous
                learning, expanding my expertise, and preparing myself for a successful and impactful professional
                journey in engineering. With discipline, resilience, and a forward-looking mindset, I strive to
                contribute meaningfully to the development of infrastructure and innovative engineering solutions.
