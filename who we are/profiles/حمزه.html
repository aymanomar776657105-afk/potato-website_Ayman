            <p> Hmza Al-Mohammadi, a second-year medical student at Sana'a University with a strong dedication to
                developing both academic and practical skills in the medical field. Beyond my studies, I enjoy exploring
                scientific topics, engaging in problem-solving activities, and participating in teamwork-oriented
                projects that enhance my critical thinking and collaboration skills. I am committed to continuous
                learning, personal growth, and building a solid foundation for a successful medical career. Looking
                ahead, I aspire to gain international exposure, broaden my perspective, and become a compassionate and
                skilled physician capable of making a meaningful impact on patients and the community. With
                determination, discipline, and enthusiasm, I am focused on shaping a rewarding and inspiring path in
                medicine.
